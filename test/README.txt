Ozark Samples
-------------

 All samples can be compiled using JDK 8 and deployed on GlassFish 4.1 or later. 

 o book-cdi: Shows how to bind view template parameters using CDI. An instance of Book in
   request scope is injected in BookController and also accessed directly by the JSP.

 o book-models: Shows how to bind view template parameters using the Models interfaces from 
   the MVC API. The Models interface allows binding of parameters by name.

 o conversation: An example on how to use the conversation scope from CDI. Note in particular
   the use of the 'cdi' query parameter to access a specific conversation. This is required 
   for any servlet-based application.

 o events: Shows how to observe for CDI events generated by the MVC implementation. Events
   are fired, for example, when an controller method is matched.

 o facelets: Shows how to use a JSF Facelet to generated an HTML response. Note the web.xml
   requirement to define the necessary servlet mapping.

 o freemarker: Shows integration with the Freemarker templating language. Defines a view
   engine implementation for Freemarker.

 o mustache: Shows integration with the Mustache templating language. Defines a view
   engine implementation for Mustache.

 o produces: A test that shows the different ways to compute the response content type. Uses
   Section 3.8 from JAX-RS specification to compute a content type dynamically if necessary.

 o requestDispatcher: A test that shows how request are dispatched if a view engine is not
   matched.

 o validation: Shows how to use Bean Validation to validate form posts on an MVC controller.
